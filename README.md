_____DISCLAIMER______

I did not edit these files, I was the one who just exported it to git from google code.

I will be updating this gamemode constantly though, I will take control over it and re-develope it for download use.

All files are free but to edit any core parts of the gamemode ask ME on steam @ http://steamcommunity.com/id/kylebroflaski/

Any questions regeuring this git please use the issue tab and use the requests tab for requests etc.

This is a darkrp remake but I will make it as better as I can making it more enjoyable etc.

------------------------------------------------------------
Enough with the nonsense, lets see how to install this baby!
------------------------------------------------------------

To install go to garrysmod/garrysmod/gamemode drop in the folder

The next step is to re-name the folder to darkrevamp

One done, you can make it the default gamemode and continue with the load up! 

Thanks! I will be updating this so be sure to keep updated!
